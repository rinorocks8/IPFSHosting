This project is purposely over engineered to display my computer science knowledge.

This project is used to deploy and provision an AWS EC2 instance as a InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) node with Terraform and a Github Actions pipeline. The project is used to update my resume on a static IPNS address linked to my ethereum domain, ryancircelli.eth.
